This is version 5.22 of the Polyhedral Library.
http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/polylib


REQUIREMENTS:
=============
All you need to build the polylib is a C compiler like gcc.

If you want the library to be overflow proof, you might install
the GNU-MP library, version 2.0.2 or more. You can get it from:
       https://gmplib.org/
or from your package distribution (libgmp-dev version)

You can also build the polylib if you don't have gmp, but it will
fail if an overflow occurs.


BUILDING:
=========
1. './configure'
2. 'make [-j]'
3. 'make tests' to test the library on a set of examples
4. 'make longtest' to run a longer test on other examples

5. 'sudo make install' to instal in /usr/local


INSTALLING THE LIB IN A PRIVATE DIRECTORY
=========================================
Run './configure --prefix=DIR'

I suggest that you also add option '--enable-onlystatic'. It does not
make much sense to build a shared object in a private directory.
If you do however, you will have to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH before
using the lib.

OTHER OPTIONS
=============
Type './configure --help' to get a complete list of options supported
by the configure script.
